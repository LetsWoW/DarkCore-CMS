This website started as a PHP learning atempt but it received a really nice feedback about it's look so I decided to release it for public use and work along with other developers to make a brand new professional FREE TRINITYCORE CMS<br><br>

#Note To Developers
As I said this website started as a PHP learning atempt so you might expect the following<br>
<ul>
    <li>First of all the code is very very bad when I started this project I only knew what echo does in PHP but this was 1 year ago so there are some repetitive functions or bad formated ones</li>
    <li>The CMS is not complete it only have the coded website and is missing the administration panel</li>
    <li>I kind of stoped the project in a style transition so the following pages were not updated yet
        <ul>
            <li>Rules Page</li>
            <li>Registration Page</li>
            <li>Guides Page</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Forum module is in very very early stages and is not working</li>
</ul>
